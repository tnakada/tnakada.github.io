Continued to build my R skills by [investigating how weather influences](Taikan_Nakada_Econ_320_final.html) Uber ridership in New York City using an enriched dataset from Kaggle. I used regression analysis (Random Forest) to identify variables with the most impact.\
\
Surprisingly, the analysis suggested that weather has minimal impact on ridership. The time of the day, and day of the week, accounting for Holidays, had the highest variable importance.
