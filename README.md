# updated website

This repo is built on a fork of **Jekyll Now** from [this repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). **Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

The website design is just a modification of [Leonid Keselman's website](https://leonidk.com/) and is converted for my own use, re-purposing my old markdown posts.
