Given a CT scan of a patient, identify voxels in the lung that show potential to be nodules.
Grouped voxels are then classified as tumors or not with 3D Convolutional NN using PyTorch.
Identified tumors are finally determined for malignancy. Data from [LUNA 2016](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/Data/).
