I"b<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02998">This paper</a> explored the possibility of leveraging quantum algorithms on quantum hardware to augment neural networks. The idea I was trying to explore is to have a quantum circuit using Qiskit in the convolutional layer of a CNN implemented in PyTorch. The quantum circuit seems advantageous in the feature mapping since itâ€™s able to explore an exponentially large space for localized patterns.<br />
