I"ä<p>Continued to build my R skills by <a href="Taikan_Nakada_Econ_320_final.html">investigating how weather influences</a> Uber ridership in New York City using an enriched dataset from Kaggle. I used regression analysis (Random Forest) to identify variables with the most impact.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, the analysis suggested that weather has minimal impact on ridership. The time of the day, and day of the week, accounting for Holidays, had the highest variable importance.</p>
